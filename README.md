This my first React app, and indeed my first time writing Javascript!

My plan is to make a pairs game that I can use to learn vocabulary and hopefully pick up some frontend/js skills along the way. 

Eventually I'll have some basic database as backing storage for decks of cards and you'll choose which deck you want to play with. Still early days right now though.
